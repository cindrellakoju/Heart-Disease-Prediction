# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical features such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and more. It uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model trained on the heart disease dataset.

## Features:
- User-friendly web form for inputting health parameters
- Predict heart disease risk based on user input
- Trained machine learning model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Scalable, using standardized feature scaling for better prediction

## Usage
To start the Flask web application, run:
python app.py
